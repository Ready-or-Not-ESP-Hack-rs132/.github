## 👁 What Is the Ready or Not ESP Hack?

ESP stands for *Extra Sensory Perception*. It’s a visual mod that displays real-time overlays on your screen to highlight critical game elements—like enemies behind walls, hidden tripwires, or even explosive devices tucked behind furniture.

It doesn’t interfere with your shooting or movement—it simply turns you into a **living radar system**.
